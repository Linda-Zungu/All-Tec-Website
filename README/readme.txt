All+Tec Website ReadMe

- To start the website, please open the home.html file.


The website is designed with a unique minimal design to make information pop, thereby creating a clean user experience. 

- The cart on the top right is your doorway to the payment page. 
    - You can only access that page once the cart has items added to it.
    - The cart is intelligent enough to see if an item is added then can let the user pay for the items. 
    - If the all the items are removed, the cart will recognize that, and not let the user go to the payment because it is unnecessary since there won't be any items to pay for.


THE COURSES TAB

- This tab is designed in such a way that when a user hovers over the it, a tray slides from the navigation bar.
- This tray has all the courses offered in the website and the user can interact with them and be directed to their respective pages.

...The user can also just click the Courses tab directly and it will lead to all the courses offered all under one page. This way, the user can simply choose all the courses and add them to the cart from there.

- When adding courses to the cart, note that a user cannot add duplicate the same course since that would be redundant because purchasing a course isn't like purchasing a certain quantity of the same product.


THE PAYMENT PAGE

- This page can only be accessed by clicking the BUY button in the cart.
- The BUY button will only appear in the cart once the it has detected that it has items added to it.

- The user will then fill in the fields provided in order to complete the transaction.
- All the fields are required.
- Once the "Make Payment" button has been clicked, an alert will appear to let the user know that transaction has been successful. 

Thank You!
